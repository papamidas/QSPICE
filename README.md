Some C++ simulation models for Digital Signal Processing with QSPICE

## fir_test.qsch
Load this file using [Qorvo's/Mike Engelhardt's wonderful QSPICE simulator](https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice)
In addition you need
## fir.cpp
and
## fir59.h
Right click on the grey box and select "C++ Interface" -> "Open C++ Source"
A text editor opens
In the text editor, right click somewhere on the page and select "Compile DLL"
In the bottom line of the text editor window you will see the message ""fir.dll" created successfully"
Go back to the simulator and press the green ON switch symbol
This starts the simulation
After some seconds (depending on the speed of your PC), a diagram window pops up and shows the simulation results
